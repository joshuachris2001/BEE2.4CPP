# BEE2.4CPP
BEE2.4 mod for portal 🍴[https://github.com/BEEmod/BEE2.4] from python to C++ as a translation (yes I am insane)<br>
so far I am in the early stages replaceing BEE2.4 mod's python libary with C++ ones<br>
[no more pyinstall ✌ ] (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
# I want Python! ＞︿＜
if you are here by mistake the orgianal one is here, this is merly a crazy f0rk 🍴<br>

[I own nothing from this program this is only a translation]<br>
[although I would like to reserve the effort I put in so negh o(≧口≦)o ]
# GOAL
this is to make a native BEE mod for linux and as native as I can get with out changing much
# METHOD
✔ go insane<br>
✔ rewrite everything by hand<br>
❌ having fun
# POGRESS
i'd say 0.01% [I only have two python libarys moved over but not tested]
(and I am doing this in my free time)
# COMPLANTS
updates may be slow<br>
if you are here to join this madness, welcome<br>
if you are here to complain that this is futile: Y0U WiL1 be InGnOr∑d<br>
